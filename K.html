        </p>
      <p>Over the past 7 years, I have participated in 2 big launching projects of mobile game (Lineage M & Lineage 2M)
      My roles were communicating with agencies and managing creative assets from planning creative strategies to handling media planning.

      The top 2 projects I admire the most are the Lineage M cinematic trailer project and  Lineage 2M launching TV project.  </p>
      <br> I. <a href = 'https://youtu.be/L9OI0SD-hTg'> Lineage M Trailer </a> <br>
      <p> This was officially my first project to do it all on my own. 
        <br> I was able to work with one of the biggest 3D cinematic company, Digic. 
        <br> Even though I am not fond of games, I still love watching new trailers of console games and 
        <br> Digic company was one of the company of making such trailers.
      <br> This project was the first to spend a big amount of money for such a high quality output. 
      <br> Also it became the guideline & the milestone of the projects that came after this. </p>
      <br> I. <a href = 'https://tv.naver.com/v/11175693'> Lineage2M Launching TVC</a> <br>
      <p> This was such a huge project. 
        <br> I went to New York and LA for the shooting of this film. 
        <br> The film took place in New York, LA, Paris, Taiwan and Osaka simultaneously. 
        <br> It was the first project in which the shooting took place abroad. 
        <br> It  was the most expensive TVAD and also a well made film I take pride in.
